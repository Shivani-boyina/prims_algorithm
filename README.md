# prims_algorithm
Implements Prim's Algorithm to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a connected graph using an adjacency matrix. Starts with the lowest-cost edge, then iteratively adds the smallest edge connecting a new vertex. Outputs MST edges and total cost. Uses a greedy approach with a near[] array for tracking.
